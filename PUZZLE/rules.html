        <h1>Rules of the Game</h1>
        <p>The rules of <strong>"Match & Flip"</strong> are simple yet engaging. Players are presented with a grid of facedown cards, each depicting different images, symbols, or numbers. The objective is to flip over pairs of cards to find matching items. Here's how to play:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Shuffle the deck of cards and arrange them facedown in a grid formation on the playing surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Turn-taking:</strong> Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time, aiming to reveal matching pairs. The order of play can be determined by mutual agreement or by random selection.</li>
            <li><strong>Matching:</strong> If a player flips over two cards that match (i.e., they have the same image, symbol, or number), they keep the pair and earn a point. The matched cards are removed from the grid, leaving empty spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-matching:</strong> If the cards flipped by a player do not match, they must be turned facedown again, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory:</strong> As players continue to flip cards, they must rely on their memory to remember the location of previously revealed cards. This adds an element of strategy and challenge to the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Winning:</strong> The game continues until all pairs of cards have been matched. The player with the most pairs (and points) at the end of the game is declared the winner.</li>
            <li><strong>Variations:</strong> "Match & Flip" offers endless possibilities for variation and customization. Players can choose different themes for the cards, adjust the grid size, or introduce additional challenges such as time limits or special abilities.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So gather your friends and family, sharpen your memory skills, and get ready for a thrilling game of <strong>"Match & Flip"</strong>!</p>
