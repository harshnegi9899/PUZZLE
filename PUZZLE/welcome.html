            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>Rule of the Game:
                The rules of "Match & Flip" are simple yet engaging. Players are presented with a grid of facedown cards, each depicting different images, symbols, or numbers. The objective is to flip over pairs of cards to find matching items. Here's how to play:</p><br>
                
            <p>1.Setup: Shuffle the deck of cards and arrange them facedown in a grid formation on the playing surface.</p><br>
                
            <p>2.Turn-taking: Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time, aiming to reveal matching pairs. The order of play can be determined by mutual agreement or by random selection.</p><br>
                
            <p>3.Matching: If a player flips over two cards that match (i.e., they have the same image, symbol, or number), they keep the pair and earn a point. The matched cards are removed from the grid, leaving empty spaces.</p><br>
                
            <P>4.Non-matching: If the cards flipped by a player do not match, they must be turned facedown again, and it becomes the next player's turn.</P><br>
                
            <p>5.Memory: As players continue to flip cards, they must rely on their memory to remember the location of previously revealed cards. This adds an element of strategy and challenge to the game.</p><br>
                
            <p>6.Winning: The game continues until all pairs of cards have been matched. The player with the most pairs (and points) at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p><br>
                
            <p> 7."Match & Flip" offers endless possibilities for variation and customization. Players can choose different themes for the cards, adjust the grid size, or introduce additional challenges such as time limits or special abilities.</p><br>
                
                So gather your friends and family, sharpen your memory skills, and get ready for a thrilling game of "Match & Flip"!
